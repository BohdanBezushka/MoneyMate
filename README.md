MoneyMate is a full-stack, responsive website built for users who want to keep track of their expenses

This project focuses on providing users with an application for recording their expenses and saving money. To add a new expense or income, the user enters the date, amount, category or source, and can optionally add a description. The app constantly displays the user's total expenses, income, and balance.

## Agile Methodology
The plan for this project was carried out using Agile Methodology. GitHub Issues, which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/BohdanBezushka/MoneyMate/issues), were used to record the User Stories, Bugs and Developer Task. These were categorised into 5 Epics/Milestones and organized into 3 Projects/Sprints.

Each User Story includes Acceptance Criteria and Tasks that are necessary for a clear and effective approach to the project, ensuring that the minimum project requirements are met.

The MoSCoW Method of Prioritisation was also used, classifying each User Story as a "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" and "Wont't have". Also, the labels "Fix bug" and "Project Task" were added for better organization.
